Hi my name is Dave, thanks for taking the time to drop by my blog.

I'm a technical lead software engineer based out of Auckland, New Zealand with a passion for all things .Net, Azure and DevOps. I have over 7 years experience in the software industry, mainly working in the insurance sector.

I've caught the serverless bug and am on a continuous learning journey developing applications that scale in the cloud predominantly targeting the Azure platform. This blog is a space for me to share some of the things I've learnt and continue to learn along the way and hopefully contribute back to the online developer community.

If you find something here that is useful to you, let me know. If you have questions or suggestions send them my way and I will make an effort to find answers and incorporate new ideas.

DT
