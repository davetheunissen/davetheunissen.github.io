Hi my name is Dave, thanks for taking the time to drop by my blog. 
I'm a technical lead software engineer based out of Auckland, New Zealand with a passion for all things software and tech related. 

This blog is space for me to share some of the things I've learnt over the years and hopefully you manage to find something of interest here.

If there are particular topics you'd like to see covered or if you just want to share your thoughts, send me a tweet.

DT
